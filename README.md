Book's code

Programs for replicating the plots and exercises in the book, "Reinforcement Learning An Introduction" second edition by Sutton and Barto.

These are the exercises that help me to understand the algorithm better and the references to other learners.

The program style is to modularize the whole into environment/model and agent to conform to the gymnasium style and can be widely used for other RL problems.
